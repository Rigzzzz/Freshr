# Freshr
Simple optimal time prediction for push notifications

To make it work you need to run the script from a python 3 environment (this script was tested using python 3.5) 
having Numpy and Pandas libraries installed.

Simply run the following command:

  python freshr_predict_push_time.py <input_file_path> <output_file_path>
  
  <input_file_path> is the path to your CSV dataset 
  <output_file_path> is the path (including file name) where you want to write the CSV file containing the results
